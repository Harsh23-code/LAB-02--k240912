TASK 01:
1.	Start
2.	input number n
3.	check if n is less than 2 then it is not prime
4.	check if n is 2 or 3 then it is prime
5.	start loop  
6.	counter=3 and iterate to the n
7.	 if n is divisible by counter more than 1 time
8.	Then It is not prime 
9.	Else Prime












TASK 02:

1.	 Ask the user to  enter day number(1-365)
2.	Make sure that the day is in range of 1-365 days
3.	If not, prompt the user to enter a valid number
4.	To check the day of a week, subtract 1 form the day number, 
5.	Compute the reminder when dividing this result by 7(N-1)%7)
6.	This remainder give you an index corresponding to a day of a week.
7.	Start the number of days from 0 and take Monday as a zero
8.	0 = Monday
9.	  1 = Tuesday
10.	 2= Wednesday
11.	 3= Thursday
12.	 4= Friday
13.	 5= Saturday
14.	 6= Sunday
15.	 END






TASK 03:
1.	Ask the user to take the two positive number x and y
2.	Suppose x=X  and y=Y
3.	Repeat the Steps until “Y” becomes Zero
4.	Calculate  the remainder r when x is divided by (r= x % y)
5.	Set x=y
6.	 Set y= r 
7.	Once b becomes 0, the value of a is the GCD of original number X AND Y 
8.	Display x as a the GCD
9.	END

TASK 01
1.	         START
2.	         Input no 1 = X
3.	         Input no 2 = Y
4.	         Input no 3 = Z
5.	         IF x<y<z
6.	
7.	          Print x is the smallest
8.	          IF y<z<x
9.	
10.	Print y is the smallest
11.	IF z<x<y
12.	Print x is the smallest








TASK 02:

1.	Input no 1 
2.	Input no 2
3.	Use the operator +
4.	Take the second number Negative, 
5.	Add these two numbers
6.	This give the same result as the subtraction of no 1 from no 2
7.	Show the Result
8.	Output = Result of subtracting “no1 from no 2”










TASK 03: 

1.	Input no 1 
2.	Input no 2
3.	Ask the user for the desired operation (either * for multiplication or / for division) 
4.	PRINT "Enter the operation (* for multiplication or / for division)
5.	Check the which operation the user has selected
6.	IF operator takes *
7.	Print   “multiply the no1 * no2”
8.	ELSE if operator takes / 
9.	Print  “divide the no1 / no 2”
10.	END
